# Network-Flows-Stuff

Constant work in progress here. So far, this repo contains:

* **network_flows.py**, containing helper functions to create data structures for network flow problems for now
* **Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Exploration.ipynb**, a notebook exploring the [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) problem, mainly some kind of hacky implementations of [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) to solve the problem in a couple small example networks.
